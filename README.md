# Generative neural network models for multi-level free energy calculations

## TL; DR
A generative neural network, adversarial autoencoder, is implemented, customized, and combined with biomolecular simulations to reduce the computational cost and error in multi-level free energy simulations by more than 10-fold compared with existing non-ML methods.

## Summary
Free energy difference between two states of a physical system is closely tied to a wide range of chemical and biological processes. The reliable estimation of free energy difference is therefore critical to many areas including protein design and drug discovery. For all applications, computational efficiency and accuracy are the most important factors but it's very hard to balance them.

The major challenge is to
